Phases of construction
I. Build the guessing mode ("single-player")
II. Make it playable/testable via app + mobile web
III. Build the constructor mode
IV. A/B test game mechanics
V. Build out 1v1 mode

I. Build the guessing mode ("single-player")

OVERVIEW
-Explain how boards are constructed
-Show how gameplay works
-Explain how the game is won


GIVEN
The subset of letters that are in play
How many words total are to be guessed
The Anchor Word (always horizontal)
All 2 letter words
?unused letters (probably not relevant until 1v1, or maybe redundent based on the playable letters )

HIDDEN
The words to be guessed, sorted in alphabetical order
    -revealed through gameplay by submitting guesses
The sums of the letter counts of each word
    -after guessing a word of x length, you get to see the amount of words that have x letters
The "position" of each word, which is determined by horizontal or vertical orientation + weather it connects to the anchor word
    -Anchor, Girder (horizontal), Crossbeam (intersect anchor), Post (vertical)
    -When you guess one of the words, this is revealed

INTERACT 
* Select which word you are going to guess for
* type/touch guessed word entry
* A grid with the anchor word that the player can try different configurations out

* A check guess button, which validates if the guess is a real word
    *correct guess: show confirmation
    *incorrect guess: for each letter, show if it is either correct, alphabetically "low" or "high"
* A guess counter



CONCLUSION
once all words have been correctly guessed, the round is over, with the score being the total number of guesses made (lower is better)
